# SuperChic MC event generator for central exclusive production

Version 5.2

See manual in `doc/` folder for further instructions!


The latest version of Superchic can be compiled with `CMake` build system.
### Build requirements: 
 - CMake (https://cmake.org/) > 3.16 or make
 - Fortran compiller: GNU, Intel, flang, NVFortran were tested
 - LHAPDF, see https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/
 - Internet connection if the installation of PDFs was requested
 - C++ compiler, HepMC3 (https://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/project/hepmc) and Pythia8 (https://pythia.org/) for the tests
 - (optional) `pfdLaTeX` and `bibtex`  to compile manual.

### Runtime requirements:

 - LHAPDF, see https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/

## Development requirements

 - APFEL, https://apfel.hepforge.org/ is needed to calculate the structure functions


## Obtaining the required dependencies

### CentOS8
Most of the dependencies are present in the default repositories
```
yum -y install epel-release
dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
yum -y install  gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran make cmake cmake-data git
yum -y install HepMC3 HepMC3-devel HepMC3-search lhapdf lhapdf-devel python-lhapdf pythia8 pythia8-devel
```
But `apfel` should be installed from the sources.
```
git clone https://github.com/scarrazza/apfel.git  && cd  apfel && ./configure --disable-pywrap --prefix=/where_you_want && make && make install && cd  ../ && rm -rf apfel
```
Alternatively, for CentOS8+ compatible distributions `apfel` can be installed from the HEPrpms (https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/averbyts/HEPrpms/)
```
yum -y install dnf-plugins-core && dnf -y copr enable averbyts/HEPrpms && yum -y install apfel  
```

### Fedora
Most of the dependencies are present in the default repositories
```
yum -y install  gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran make cmake cmake-data git
yum -y install HepMC3 HepMC3-devel HepMC3-search lhapdf lhapdf-devel python-lhapdf pythia8 pythia8-devel
```
But `apfel` should be installed from the sources.
```
git clone https://github.com/scarrazza/apfel.git  && cd  apfel &&  cmake  -S . -B BUILD -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where_you_want && cmake --build BUILD -j 8 && cmake --install BUILD && cd  ../ && rm -rf apfel
```
Alternatively, for the 3 most recent Fedora versions `apfel` can be installed from the HEPrpms (https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/averbyts/HEPrpms/)
```
yum -y install dnf-plugins-core && dnf -y copr enable averbyts/HEPrpms && yum -y install apfel  
```

### MacOS X
All the dependencies are present in the `homebrew`(https://brew.sh/) repositories
```
brew tap davidchall/hep
brew install gcc cmake hepmc3 apfel lhapdf
```

## Building SuperChic with cmake (recommended)

```
cmake -S . -B BUILD <extra flags>
cmake --build BUILD
cmake --install BUILD
```

and optionally

```
ctest --test-dir BUILD
```
to run all the tests.


The extra flags might be:
- generic CMake flags, e.g. `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/home/dir`, `-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort`, `-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-O2 -g"`, etc.
- flags pointing to the dependencies, `-DLHAPDF_DIR=/where/the/LHAPDF/is`
- flags that regulate the compilation. In the current version there are the following flags: 
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_TESTS=ON/OFF`     Enables building of tests.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_FPES=ON/OFF`      Enables floating point exceptions in the code.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_DOCS=ON/OFF`      Enables building of PDF manual. 
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_SHARED=ON/OFF`    Enables building of shared library. 
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_INSTALL_LIBRARIES=ON/OFF`Enables installation of libraries. 
 
 The following options makes sense only when the testing is enabled.
 
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_ALL_TESTS=ON/OFF` Enables building of much more tests.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_DOWNLOAD_PDFS=ON/OFF`    Enables downloading of PDFs for tests. 
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_PP=ON/OFF`        Enables testing with pp beams.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_EE=ON/OFF`        Enables testing with ee beams.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_AA=ON/OFF`        Enables testing with AA beams.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_PA=ON/OFF`        Enables testing with pA beams. 
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_RIVET=ON/OFF`     Enables testing with Rivet.
 - `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_PROFILE=ON/OFF`   Enables callgrind profiling.

## Building SuperChic with make (not recommended )
Make sure the `lhapdf-config` is in the `PATH`
``
make -f makefile.make
``

## Running SuperChic

The options to run SuperChic, i.e. executables `superchic` and `init` are desribed in the manual.

### Environment variables
SuperChic needs a set of data files to run.
In the source and build tree those are located in `share/SuperChic` directory.
After the installation in the runtime the location of the files is `${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}/SuperChic`. Typically that is 
`/usr/share/SuperChic` or `/usr/local/share/SuperChic` directory.
The location of those files in runtime can be overwitten with an environment variable `SUPERCHIC_DATA_PATH`.


The location of the PDFs can be set with the environment variable `LHAPDF_DATA_PATH`, see the LHAPDF socumentation. 
This is done automatically in the test suite.


## Debugging SuperChic

For the debug purposes it is useful to compile SeuperChic with the following options (assuming GNU compilers)
```
-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_FPES=ON -DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_TESTS=ON -DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_ALL_TESTS=ON -DSUPERCHIC_DOWNLOAD_PDFS=ON -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-O2 -g"
```

## Developing  SuperChic
The CMake build system has a developer-only option `SUPERCHIC_ENABLE_APFELSF`. With this option turned on,
an executable `apfelsf` can be build (APFEL and LHAPDF are required). The executable can be used to rebuild the SF "pseudo-PDFs',e.g.
```
cmake -S . -B BUILD -DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_APFELSF=ON
cmake --build BUILD
BUILD/apfelsf <PDFNAME>

```
The results will be stored in the directory SF_<PDFNAME>. <PDFNAME> should be installed and accessible by LHAPDF.
