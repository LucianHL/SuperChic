SuperChic MC event generator for central exclusive production
Version 4.22
See manual in doc/ folder for further instructions!

The latest version of Superchic can be compiled with CMake build system.
Requirements: 
 - CMake>3.16
 - Fortran compiller: GNU, INtel, flang, NVFortran were tested
 - APFEL
 - LHAPDF
 - Internet connection if the installation of PDFs was requested

To build:
``
cmake -S . -B BUILD <extra flags>
cmake --build BUILD
cmake --install BUILD
```
and optionally
```
ctest --test-dir BUILD
```


The extra flags might be:
- generic CMake flags, e.g. `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/home/dir`, `-DCMAKE_fortran_COMPILER=ifort`, etc.
- flags pointing to the dependencies, `-DLHAPDF_DIR=/where/the/LHAPDF/is`, `-DAPFEL_DIR=/where/the/APFEL/is`
- flags that regulate the compilation. In the current version there are two flags: `-DSUPERCHIC_ENABLE_TESTS=ON/OFF` (Enables building of tests) and
`-DSUPERCHIC_DOWNLOAD_PDFS=ON/OFF`(Enables downloading of PDFs for tests).
